The project will load an initial list of restaurants found in Springfield, Illinois.  The following actions can be performed on this page.

<ul>
	<li>The down arrow next to the words "Search Results" will expand the list of restaurants in the view.  It will then become and up arrow and can be used to hide the list of results.</li>
	<li>The textbox and search button can be used to search for specific restaurant names from this initial list of restaurants.  This will update the list of restaurants and the map markers to only show matching results.</li>
	<li>When a marker is clicked or a list item is selected, a window will appear to show a information about the restaurant from FourSquare and link to the FourSquare page for that restaurant if the information can be found.</li>
